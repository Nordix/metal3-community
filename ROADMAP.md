# Metal3 Roadmap

The Metal3 Roadmap is maintained as a GitHub project and can be found
[here](https://github.com/orgs/metal3-io/projects/2).

## Description

Each column in the project represents the work items for a specific release of
either Baremetal Operator, Cluster API Provider Metal3, IP Address Manager,
Ironic image and other Metal3 components. In addition there is
a `Feature Requests` column that contains items that have not yet been
accepted and the `Backlog` column that contains items that have been accepted
but not yet planned for a specific release.

An issue can be planned for a specific release if someone volunteers to take
ownership of the feature. The owner will then be assigned the issue. An owner
does not have to carry the whole design and implementation processes on her own
but must instead make sure that the feature is being worked on and will be
completed by the planned release date.

## Proposing a feature

Proposing a new feature for a specific release of one of the components is done
by opening an issue in the [metal3-docs](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs)
repository, describing the feature and which components and release are
targeted. The new issue will automatically appear in the feature request
column of the roadmap.

## Updating the Roadmap

Updating the roadmap is done during a community meetup or community meeting, with
a discussion within the members of the projects, alternatively through an email
thread. The update is performed by one of the maintainers of the Metal3 project.

A new feature proposal is moved from the `Feature Requests` column to a
component release column if agreed within the community, and a member
volunteers to take ownership of that feature. If a feature is seen as
necessary in the long-term without being planned for the releases defined,
it is then placed in the `Backlog` column. An issue from the `Backlog` can be
moved to a specific release when someone volunteers to take ownership of the
issue.

An inactive issue in one of the releases (marked as stale) can be moved back to
the `Backlog` column, and issues in the `Feature Requests` column that are not
actual feature proposals but issues related to metal3-docs repository can be
removed from the project.

## Community Meetup

The Roadmap of the Metal3 project is discussed mainly in community meetups.
Meetups are usually long discussions within the community members and the
specific focus is to discuss long term goals and Roadmap for the project.

First Metal3 meetup was arranged on 15th of May 2023. Here is the
